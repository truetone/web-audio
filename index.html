            <h2>Simple Oscilloscope</h2>
            <p><small>December 25, 2017</small></p>

            <p><a href="2/">This experiment</a> creates a waveform and provides a simple visualization in real time.</a></p>
            <h2>Generative Music (Experiment 1)</h2>

            <p><small>December 24, 2017</small></p>

            <p><a href="1/">This experiment</a> is inspired by <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_music">Brian Eno's
            concept of generative music</a>, which is:</p>

            <blockquote>
                any music that is ever-different &amp; changing, created by a system.
            </blockquote>

            <p><a href="https://teropa.info/loop/">These slides</a> inspired me
            to think about looping in the context of generative music, which
            then inspired me to start exploring <a
            href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API">the
            JavaScript web audio API</a> again. <a href="1/">This experiment is
            the first step in that direction</a>.</p>

            <p>I'm creating several oscillator tones with varying wave forms
            (sine, square, triangle and sawtooth). A couple sets of tones are
            configured to play a C major chord in the background. Another set
            of four tones plays the same simple melody in a loop, but at
            varying times. Finally, there is a set of bass tones that play in
            regular time to create a predictable rhythm.</p>

            <p>The notes of the melody change over time, go in and
            out of phase and become more dissonant the longer you listen.
            Eventually the notes resolve back into a more consonant chord.</p>

            <p>In my opinion, the longer you listen, the more interesting this
            gets. Occasionally, the tones create some really interesting
            harmonics. None of this is recorded. This is all being created in
            real time, by the browser.</p>

            <p>I also used this opportunity to play around with the CSS Grid
            for layout.</p>

            <p><strong>This first experiment won't work yet on iOS devices
            because Apple puts AudioContext into a suspended state that
            requires user interaction to resume.</strong> At this point I don't
            have anything set up to do that. This is <em>experimental</em>
            after all. Also this may break at any time since the API is still
            changing.</p>
